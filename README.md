icepool-board
=============

KiCad 5 designs for the icepool project.

icepool is a general purpose multi-FPGA circuit board designed around
Lattice ICE40 FPGAs.

Key features include,

- Host ARM processor for serial communication, debugging, and programming of FPGAs.
- Broadcast interface for sending data from host to all FPGAs.
- FIFO interface for data passing between FPGAs.

The goal is to produce an inexpensive, flexible multi-core parallel co-processor
for embedded computing projects.
